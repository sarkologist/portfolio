# a Java library
This is a Java convenience library for outputting the HTML source for comboboxes. The preexisting library code for this was a mess of copy-and-paste methods catering to variants on combobox contents. I have reduced it to two natural methods called in the fluent style. The code reduction is a factor of ten, though the old code has been omitted to protect the guilty.

## note
Please note that the non-use of generics was because our team was using Java 1.4.
